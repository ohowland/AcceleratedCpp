Q: If we define the name function as a plain nonconst member function, what other
functions in our system must change and why?

A: from book: Because the function gaurantees that it will not change the values
in the object, we can call it for const objects. By the same token, we cannot
call nonconst functions on const objects.

So we're looking for functions calling -> const Student_info& 's' <- that have 
s.name() uses.

compare() would need to change. That's it, test compile throws that flag as well.
